# InvoiceCaseStudy
Case Study 
The Case Study is based off an invoice with over 528,960 rows and 33 feature columns. Below are the case study questions I will be focusing on answering. The code and answers I have written were completed within the 3-4 hour time limit, leaving room for imporovement for data cleaning, more analysis for insigths on releationships, and better graphing.
